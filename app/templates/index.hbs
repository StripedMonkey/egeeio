      Egee.io hosts a number of game servers! Every server is moderated by a member of the community and publicly (no white-lists!).

    <p>
      Members of the Egee.io community can also host their own game servers and have them showcased here on Egee.io. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egee.io Discord server is the official place for server news and community information. It's the place where we plan gaming events and live streams - Feel free to join us!
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't have to be a part of the Discord server to join our servers! Just use the domain name (egee.io) or find one of our servers in your game's server browser and join!
